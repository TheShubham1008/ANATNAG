                The boundless beauty and majesty of Kashmir Valley is so alluring and captivating that since ages, this
                land has been exposed to sudden metamorphosis of its religious and political status.
                As an integral part of this valley, Anantnag was also witness to change of rulers and regimes several
                times in its history.
                The history of this place is also quite intriguing because of its existence dating back to prehistoric
                era. It finds its mention in the ancient epics and chronicles that exhibit the significance of this land
                in Indian history.
                Right from its name to its historical sites, Anantnag has lot in store for every avid historian.
                <br>
                Anantnag finds its mention in Hindu mythology as a place where Lord Shiva dropped his numerous serpents
                on his way to Amarnath caves. Hence it got this name meaning ‘countless’ (Anant) ‘serpents (Nag)’.
                In Bhagvada Gita, the city finds its citation as ‘I am Anantnag’. This era is believed to have the
                strongest impact on the nomenclature of Anantnag. In Sanskrit, Anant means infinite and nag refers to
                springs in Kashmiri lingo.
                Hence it can be said that Anantnag got this name due to the numerous springs originating from this
                place.
                There is also the great Anant Nag spring that flows through the heart of this city and perhaps, that may
                have given its name thus. In most of the ancient mythological chronicles of Hindus, Anantnag is believed
                to have derived its name from these springs.
                It is a fact validated by local historians as well as inscriptions of Koshur and Neelmat Purana.
                <br>
                With its existence since 5000 BC, it is one of the oldest human establishments in the world. It is said
                that before 1320 when Muslims had not ascended in this region, the whole Kashmir was segregated into
                three different divisions that included Yamraj in its center,
                Maraj towards the South and Kamraj towards North. This division of land resulted from the war of throne
                between two brothers Marhan and Kaman.
                Current capital of Kashmir, Srinagar was the center point or Yamraj. Maraj was the name given to stretch
                of land between Pir Panjal ranges and Srinagar.
                This area is now called as Anantnag. Towards the south of Srinagar, was Kamraj. It is believed by some
                of the historians that this segregation of valley was later continued as its division into 34 sub
                divisions, though after 1871, they were made 5 districts.
                Remnants of the ancient historical era of Anantnag can be found in historical sites like Martand Sun
                Temple which was built during the reign of Lalitaditya, the mighty emperor of Kashmir in 725 to 756 AD.
                The temple was later destroyed by Muslim invaders and it is still standing majestically, though, in
                ruins.
